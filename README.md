# Drizzle-Drip
 
This is my first attempt at creating a game completely from scratch (with the help of Github Copilot). I had a random idea for a "rookie" weatherman trying to accurately predict the weather. I wanted the gimmick to be that the "weather" previews were just social media texts littered with slang. You'd have to try and intepret the slang and guess what the forecast currently is. As levels progress, the timing window gets shorter, there are more weather types, and possibly some additional difficulty modifiers.

The idea behind this personal project isn't to make anything good, or even necessarily fun, I really just felt like making a game without following some course or tutorial. I want to add working menus, some kind of VFX, some kind of SFX, and a couple tracks. And also play around with the gameplay a bit.
